Here we make available the SKIRT input files used to create simple models that demonstrate the spatial pattern of the polarization angle resulting from the polarizing process being scattering dominated.

To install / learn how to use SKIRT please check: https://skirt.ugent.be/root/_documentation.html

We also provide the scripts used to process the outputs of the SKIRT simulations.
